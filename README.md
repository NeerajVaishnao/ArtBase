# ArtBase
ArtBase is a virtual data keeping firm for art galleries. This project was made during DBMS Course at IIIT-Delhi. The application is made in Django keeping a fixed database schema in consideration.

## Problem Statement
You want to set up a database company, ArtBase, that builds a product for art
galleries. The core of this product is a database with a schema that captures all the
information that galleries need to maintain.
Galleries keep information about artists, their names (which are unique), birthplaces,
age,and style of art. For each piece of artwork, the artist, the year it was made, its
unique title, its type of art (e.g., painting, lithograph, sculpture, photograph), and its price
must be stored. Pieces of artwork are also classified into groups of various kinds, for
example, portraits, still lifes, works by Picasso, or works of the 19th century; a given
piece may belong to more than one group

Each group is identified by a name (like those just given) that describes the group.
Finally, galleries keep information about customers. For each customer, galleries keep
that personâ€™s unique name, address, total amount of dollars spent in the gallery, and the artists and groups of art that the customer tends to like.

## TODO
* Add more functionalities to adhere all possible(mostly) needs of the users.
* Integrate with Bootstrap.
